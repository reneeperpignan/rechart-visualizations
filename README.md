# rechart-visualizations
Creating charts using Charts.js that would be useful for CRW to see

## Insights:
I only had time to use the recharts.js library, but overall making the charts was very easy. Especially with the fact you only had to edit the data keys and copy and paste the structure as HTML elements made for a very quick implementation. One issue I did run into though was customizing the charts themselves. There was no easy way to edit the size of the y-axis so all of the data was shown for one of the charts. Another issue was editing everything so all the labels can be seen.

Unfortunately I wasn't able to use any of the actual data provided since there doesn't seem to be an easy way to use quantifiable information.
